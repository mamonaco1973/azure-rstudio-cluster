# Azure RStudio Cluster with Azure Files-Backed Shared Libraries  

This project extends the original **Azure Mini Active Directory** lab by deploying an **RStudio Server cluster** on Microsoft Azure. The cluster is designed for data science and analytics workloads, where multiple users need a scalable, domain-joined environment with consistent package management.

Instead of relying only on per-user libraries stored on ephemeral VM disks, this solution integrates **Azure Files** as a shared package and data backend. This allows RStudio nodes in a **Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS)** to mount a common Azure Files share, ensuring that installed R packages and project files are accessible across all nodes.  

### Key capabilities demonstrated:  

1. **RStudio Server Cluster with Application Gateway** – RStudio Server (Open Source Edition) deployed across multiple VM instances, fronted by an Azure Application Gateway for high availability and seamless user access.  
2. **Azure Files-Backed Shared Library** – Azure Files share mounted at `/nfs/rlibs` (Linux NFS mount) and injected into `.libPaths()`, enabling shared R package storage across the cluster.  
3. **Mini Active Directory Integration** – A Samba-based mini-AD domain controller provides authentication and DNS, so RStudio logins are domain-based and centrally managed.  

Together, this architecture provides a reproducible, cloud-native RStudio environment where users get both personal home-directory libraries and access to a shared, scalable package repository.

### Build Results  

When the deployment completes, the following resources are created:  

- **Resource Groups:**  
  - **rstudio-mini-ad-rg** - Mini-AD components
  - **rstudio-network-rg** – Networking, Bastion, and Key Vault  
  - **rstudio-servers-rg** – Domain-joined Linux/Windows servers and storage integration  
  - **rstudio-vmss-rg** – RStudio VM Scale Set (VMSS), Application Gateway, and related cluster infra  

- **Networking:**  
  - A VNet with dedicated subnets for Active Directory, VMSS cluster nodes, Bastion, and Application Gateway  
  - Azure Bastion for secure RDP/SSH access without public IPs  
  - Route tables configured for outbound internet access, AD lookups, and storage access  

- **Security & Identity:**  
  - NSGs for domain controller, VMSS nodes, bastion, and storage endpoints  
  - Azure Key Vault for credential storage (admin + user accounts)  
  - Managed Identities for VMSS instances to retrieve secrets from Key Vault  

- **Active Directory Server:**  
  - Ubuntu VM running Samba 4 as Domain Controller and DNS server  
  - Configured Kerberos realm and NetBIOS name for authentication  
  - Administrator credentials securely stored in Key Vault  

- **RStudio Cluster (VMSS):**  
  - Linux VM Scale Set (VMSS) hosting RStudio Server nodes built from a Packer-generated custom image  
  - Azure Application Gateway providing public access, load balancing, health probes, and cookie-based affinity  
  - Autoscaling policies to add/remove RStudio nodes based on CPU utilization  

- **Azure Files Storage:**  
  - Premium Storage Account with SMB and NFS protocol enabled  
  - File shares provisioned for shared R libraries (`/nfs/rlibs`) and user home directories  

- **File Access Integration:**  
  - RStudio VMSS instances mount the Azure Files NFS share for shared R libraries and project data  
  - Domain-joined Windows clients (optional) can connect directly via SMB to the same Azure Files shares  
  - This provides a unified storage backend across Linux (NFS) and Windows (SMB) clients  

- **Sample R Workloads:**  
  - Example R scripts (Monte Carlo, bell curve, surface plotting, etc.) included to validate the environment  

### Users and Groups  

The domain controller provisions **sample users and groups** via Terraform templates. These are intended for testing and demonstration.  

#### Groups Created

### Creating a New RStudio User

Follow these steps to provision a new user in the Active Directory domain and validate their access to the RStudio cluster:

1. **Connect to the Domain Controller**  
   - Log into the **`win-ad`** server via **Bastion**
   - Use the `rpatel` or `jsmith` credentials that were provisioned during cluster deployment.  

2. **Launch Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**  
   - From the Windows Start menu, open **“Active Directory Users and Computers.”**  
   - Enable **Advanced Features** under the **View** menu. This ensures you can access the extended attribute tabs (e.g., UID/GID mappings).  

3. **Navigate to the Users Organizational Unit (OU)**  
   - In the left-hand tree, expand the domain (e.g., `rstudio.mikecloud.com`).  
   - Select the **Users** OU where all cluster accounts are managed.  

4. **Create a New User Object**  
   - Right-click the Users OU and choose **New → User.**  
   - Provide the following:  
     - **Full Name:** Descriptive user name (e.g., “Mike Cloud”).  
     - **User Logon Name (User Principal Name / UPN):** e.g., `mcloud@rstudio.mikecloud.com`.  
     - **Initial Password:** Set an initial password.

5. **Assign a Unique UID Number**  
   - Open **PowerShell** on the AD server.  
   - Run the script located at:  
     ```powershell
     Z:\nfs\azure-rstudio-cluster\06-utils\getNextUID.bat
     ```  
   - This script returns the next available **`uidNumber`** to assign to the new account.  

6. **Configure Advanced Attributes**  
   - In the new user’s **Properties** dialog, open the **Attribute Editor** tab.  
   - Set the following values:  
     - `gidNumber` → **10001** (the shared GID for the `rstudio-users` group).  
     - `uid` → match the user’s AD login ID (e.g., `rpatel`).  
     - `uidNumber` → the unique numeric value returned from `getNextUID.ps1`.  

7. **Add Group Memberships**  
   - Go to the **Member Of** tab.  
   - Add the user to the following groups:  
     - **rstudio-users** → grants standard RStudio access.  
     - **us** (or other geographic/departmental group as applicable).  

8. **Validate User on Linux**  
   - Open an **Bastion** session to the **`nfs-gateway`** instance.  
   - Run the following command to confirm the user’s identity mapping:  
     ```bash
     id mcloud
     ```  
   - Verify that the output shows the correct **UID**, **GID**, and group memberships (e.g., `rstudio-users`).  

![Linux](linux.png)

9. **Validate RStudio Access**  
   - Open the RStudio cluster’s Application Gateway's URL in a browser (e.g., `https://rstudio-alb-xxxxxx.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`).  
   - Log in with the new AD credentials.  

10. **Verify Permissions**  
   - By default, the new user is **not** a member of the `rstudio-admin` group.  
   - Attempting to install packages into the **shared library path `/nfs/rlibs`** should fail with a **“Permission denied”** error.  
   - This confirms the user is restricted to installing packages in their **personal user library** only.  

---

✅ **Note:** If you need the user to have administrative rights (e.g., the ability to install packages into the shared library), add them to the **rstudio-admin** group in addition to `rstudio-users`.

### Clean Up  

When finished, remove all resources with:  

```bash
./destroy.sh
```  

This uses Terraform to delete the VNet, VMs, Key Vault, storage accounts, NSGs, and secrets.
